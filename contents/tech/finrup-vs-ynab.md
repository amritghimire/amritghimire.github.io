## Philosophical Differences

### YNAB: The Budget Methodology

YNAB isn't just software—it's a complete budgeting methodology called "The Four Rules":

**Rule 1: Give Every Dollar a Job**
Assign all your money to specific categories before spending.

**Rule 2: Embrace Your True Expenses**
Break large, infrequent expenses into monthly amounts.

**Rule 3: Roll With The Punches**
Move money between categories as life happens.

**Rule 4: Age Your Money**
Aim to spend money you earned 30+ days ago.

**Enforcement**: YNAB's software enforces these rules. You must assign all money before the app "lets you" spend it (conceptually).

### Finrup: Flexible Financial Tracking

Finrup takes a more flexible approach:

**Core Philosophy**:
- Track all transactions accurately
- Set goals that matter to you
- Visualize spending patterns
- Adapt to your personal financial style

**Freedom**: Finrup doesn't enforce a specific methodology. Works with zero-based budgeting, 50/30/20 rule, or custom approaches.

**Approach**: Tool that adapts to your method rather than method that requires specific tool use.

### 2. Budgeting Approach and Methodology

#### Finrup: Flexible Tracking

**How It Works**:
1. Set up accounts (checking, savings, credit cards, etc.)
2. Create categories matching your life
3. Track transactions as they occur

#### YNAB: Structured Methodology

**How It Works**:
1. Enter or sync your account balances

4. Move money between categories as needed ("roll with the punches")
5. Fund next month's budget with this month's income
6. Eventually "age your money" to 30+ days

**The YNAB Way**:
- Must assign all money before budgeting month begins
- Categories can't go negative without explicit reallocation
- Focus on monthly spending plan
- Emphasis on breaking the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle

**Structure**: Highly structured. The software guides you through the method.
