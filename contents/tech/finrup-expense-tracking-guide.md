### 2. Be Consistent with Categories

Stick to your categorization system. Consistency makes reports more meaningful.

### 3. Add Meaningful Notes

Brief notes help you remember context later. "Coffee" vs "Coffee meeting with Sarah about project" tells different stories.

### 4. Review Weekly

Set aside 10 minutes each week to review your spending, reconcile with bank statements, and adjust categories if needed.

### 5. Set Realistic Budgets

Use Finrup's goal tracking to set achievable spending limits for each category.

### 6. Use Multiple Accounts Properly

If you have a credit card, track it as a negative-balance account. This gives you accurate net worth calculations.

### 7. Don't Forget Income

Track income sources too. Complete financial picture requires both sides of the equation.

### 8. Leverage Automation

Set up recurring transactions for predictable expenses. Use Siri Shortcuts for common transaction types.
