-***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***

You looked at my eye. <br>
You asked “**Who am I?**” <br>

Your nature of question, <br>
That confused me. <br>
I replied, <br>
“**You are who you’ve always dreamt to be.**” <br>

You asked again, <br>
“**Who am I to you?**” <br>
I started thinking, <br>
Should I say, everything I knew? <br>

You are the one, <br>
staying in my heart <br>
The pills to my soul <br>
healing bruised part. <br>

You are my sanctuary, <br>
Tranquil and  peaceful. <br>
You are the reason, <br>
I am so blissful, <br>

Afraid, that I will scare you, <br>
I managed to utter, <br>
“**You are my present, you are my future**” <br>
