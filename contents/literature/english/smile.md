-***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***

All of a sudden, I find myself smiling, <br>
by a mere mention of your name.<br>
A small memory in my mind rising,<br>
And my heart is not the same.<br>

My friend started asking,<br>
“Who is behind the smile?”<br>
I found myself basking,<br>
In your memory for a while<br>

You are the peace to my chaos,<br>
A beautiful mess to my existence<br>

You are a beautiful soul,<br>

Whose eyes do radiates,<br>
With smile so innocent.<br>
Who has an enchanting face,<br>
And heart so magnificent.<br>
Whose voice is so sweet,<br>
Makes my heart skip a beat,<br>


You are the one,

Whose conversation is highlight of my day,<br>
Much more than your transient beauty,<br>
Who is strong, who is charming and who is smart<br>
Oh dear, you are the reason behind my smile.<br>
