-***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***

All these years, I lived, <br>
Happily I might add.<br>
Something was missing,<br>
From all that I had,<br>

And then, I met you,<br>
Like the dream I knew<br>

Just a simple glance,<br>
A harmony of your voice.<br>
Just a hello by chance,<br>
A notification of your choice,

And then I fell,<br>
For your spell<br>
With all youâ€™ve got,<br>
How could I not?<br>

With every conversation,<br>
we find common ground.<br>
With every discussion,<br>
our thoughts are bound.<br>
With every imagination,<br>
All same things we found.<br>

You should hear the stories I think of,<br>
When I imagine the meeting with you,<br>
All words disappear into the ether<br>
For some reason, when I meet you,<br>

Oh, I am in a lot of trouble,<br>
You will be the beginning of me.<br>
And for all the reason,<br>
I want you to be.<br>
