-***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***

All the things we said, <br>
And those, left unsaid<br>
The conversation we had<br>
We were close and glad,<br>

So peaceful, so sublime<br>
I still remember the time<br>

The way you looked at me,<br>
And how my heart melts,<br>
The moment we were having<br>
Doesnâ€™t compare to any else<br>

The blush, the smile<br>
You threw my way,<br>
You have no idea,<br>
How it made my day.<br>

The wind was whistling the music,<br>
The birds were singing their song,<br>
The lyrics, they Felt elusive,<br>
And you went singing along<br>

The stars were flickering,<br>
The soft rain bickering,<br>
It felt like a perfect date,<br>
With a lovely stamp from fate<br>
