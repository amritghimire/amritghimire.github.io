 -***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***

Someone asked for some clue.<br>
What do I like about you?<br>
The reason  I am blown,<br>
is not only your eyes.<br>
The tiny flaws you own,<br>
that’s what mesmerize.<br>

I like those dimple,<br>
decorating your smile.<br>
Innocent and simple,<br>
Your charming style.<br>
The transient beauty is great,<br>
but with time, it will fade,<br>
Your future wrinkles await,<br>
to be my dear trait.<br>

Your talent keeps me in awe.<br>
Makes me forget all that I saw.<br>
The passion you show,<br>
when you do something.<br>
The way you grow,<br>
My hearts was thumping.<br>


How special I feel.<br>
With the fervent zeal.<br>
You are strong and able,<br>
for problems you see.<br>
You don’t shy to be vulnerable,<br>
When you are with me.<br>

The way you look at me.<br>
I feel perfect as I can be.<br>
The effortless conversation.<br>
The intimate discussion.<br>
Every little thing.<br>
The smile they bring.<br>

Above all else I said.<br>
The future ahead.<br>
Where our dreams collide,<br>
**That’s what I replied**. <br>
