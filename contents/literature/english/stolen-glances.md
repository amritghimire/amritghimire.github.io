-***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***


Both of us, <br>
Among our own friends. <br>
Separated thus, <br>
By chairs and distance. <br>

And still we find one another, <br>
Lost in thoughts of each other. <br>
You thought I didnâ€™t notice, <br>
Probably I liked to assume the same. <br>
But the thrill in stolen glance, <br>
Definitely is worth the fame. <br>

Your charm radiating in your dance, <br>
I was helpless and mesmerized. <br>
With a swift and shy glance, <br>
Oh, you had me hypnotized. <br>
I tried to freeze moment, <br>
You saw and threw me a smile. <br>
If only I could capture feeling. <br>
And replay it for a while. <br>

With a lot of courage, <br>
I was about approach you <br>
You probably saw me nervous, <br>
And came to my rescue <br>

The beautiful sunset, <br>
With the rays between us <br>
We will never forget, <br>
How the time has seen us <br>

The effortless conversation, <br>
Deep and glorious fun. <br>
With so much anticipation, <br>
Star was waiting for its turn. <br>

With the audience from stars, <br>
Seeing the wind drive. <br>
With moonlight above us, <br>
The lake shore felt more alive. <br>
