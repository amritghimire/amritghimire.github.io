-***AmRit Ghimire 'Ranjit'***

I still remember the day, we  met.


The curious look you had,<br>
The tiny twinkle that lies.<br>
If only I could get mad,<br>
Swimming through those eyes.<br>
Every little details of the moment,<br>
That got imprinted in my mind<br>
The tiny quirks that highlights<br>
Your beauty more refined.<br>

I still remember,<br>
Those small imperfection,<br>
That drew me closer,<br>
The warmth you radiate,<br>
Made me turn over and over<br>

The one conversation we had,<br>
Both deep and light hearted,<br>
The sincerity you emitted,<br>
And the silly stuff you started,<br>

How smart, yet humble,<br>
How strong, yet soft.<br>
All makes me crumble,<br>
Makes me stay aloft<br>
